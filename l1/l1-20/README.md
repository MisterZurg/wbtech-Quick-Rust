> [!TIP]
> The Adapter Pattern
> The Adapter pattern serves as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, 
> enabling one class to work with methods and properties of another class that it otherwise wouldn't be able to. 
> 
> Think of it as a real-world adapter: just like you'd use a power adapter to connect your laptop's plug to a foreign electrical outlet, 
> the Adapter pattern lets you connect unfamiliar interfaces in your code.
